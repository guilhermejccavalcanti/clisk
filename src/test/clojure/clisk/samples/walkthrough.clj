;;   Run each of the individual "show" lines in the walkthough

;; colours in RGB  
(show [1 0 0])

;; scalars get interpreted as greyscale
(show 0.5)
(show [0.5 0.5 0.5])

;; named colours
(show pink)

;; adding in a variable
(show [x 0 0])
(show [0 y 0])

;; addition
(show (v+ 
        [x 0 0] 
        [0 y 0]))

;; multiplication
(show (v* [x y 0] 5))


;; what's under the hood?
(node [x y 0])

;; code generation
(let [a (node [x y 0])]

(show (scale 0.2 noise))
